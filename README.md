# Gazi University Campus Mobile App

This is a group project developed collaboratively by students from **Gazi University**.  
The application is designed to support campus life for students. It includes the following features:

- Latest announcements on the home page  
- Club information  
- To-do list  
- Dining hall (yemekhane) menus  
- Things to do in Ankara

## My Contribution

I was responsible for the design and database integration of the Ankara Page.  
This includes a dynamic scroll design that updates based on data from the database and API.  

We fetched up-to-date events happening in Ankara from **etkinlik.io** via API integration.  
Users can explore locations of attractions by opening their phone's native Maps application directly from the app.

Additionally, users can rate each place, and these ratings are saved back to the database,  
enabling personalized feedback and data persistence.


## Technologies Used

- Java (for Android)
- XML (layouts)
- Android Studio

## Credits
